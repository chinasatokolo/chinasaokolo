### Hey everyone  👋🏾

I'm a Fellow at the Brookings Institution and a recent PhD graduate in Computer Science at Cornell University with research interests in AI governance, global development, and human-centered AI! Within these fields, I work on projects related to improving AI governance capacity in the Global South, upskilling novice AI users, examining human-centered approaches to AI explainability, and analyzing the future of data work. My dissertation research examined how frontline healthcare workers in rural India perceive AI and analyzed how AI explainability can meet the needs of novice technology users in the Global South.

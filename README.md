### Hey everyone  👋🏾

<!--
**chinasaokolo/chinasaokolo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at Cornell University with research interests in computer vision, global health, human-AI interaction, and ICTD! Within these fields, I work on projects in rural India to understand how frontline healthcare workers perceive and value AI/XAI. I also examine how explainability can be best leveraged in AI-enabled technologies deployed throughout the Global South, with a focus on healthcare.

In my free time, I love to travel, scroll down my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/chinasza) feed, [blog](http://www.collegesista.com), compose songs, learn about venture capital, and pursue entrepreneurial endeavors.
